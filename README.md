# MonteCarloSimulations

R code to examine whether miRs mapped to pain/ptsd genes occurred more in genes of interest than in the same number of genes randomly selected from the human genome. Exact p value was calculated from the background distribution created from 10,000 runs of a Monte Carlo simulation. MC selected 402 genes from ~13,000 (ones that had miRs from miRbase).
